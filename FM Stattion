FM broadcasting is a method of radio broadcasting using frequency modulation. Invented in 1933 by American engineer Edwin Armstrong, wide-band FM is used worldwide to provide high fidelity sound over broadcast radioFM is short for frequency modulation, which refers to the means of encoding the audio signal on the carrier frequency. FM full power, low power, translator and booster stations operate in the 88 â€“ 108 MHz band. There are many classes of radio stations.
AM (amplitude modulation) and FM (frequency modulation) are types of modulation (coding). The sound of the program material, usually coming from a radio studio, is used to modulate (vary) a carrier wave of a specific frequency, then broadcast.

The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn't let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.
